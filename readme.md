<h3>Deployment</h3>

This project was created using visual studio code, using GitHub desktop I was able to edit local repositories and then
push them to the origin online on GitHub. After every session of editing the website I would commit all changes made and
did this regularly throughout the development process. At one point I had lost a lot of progress because none of my work
was backed up. After this I made sure to back up all files.
