<h1>Harrison Webbs Website Project</h1>
This Project is a responsive website to showcase all the knowledge and skills learnt during my course Code+.
This webiste gives an explanation of what it is trying to achieve, it also showcases my skills as well as a little bit about me.
It is easy to use and achieves the goal of displaying different techniques of front end website development.

<h3>Deployment</h3>

This project was created using visual studio code, using GitHub desktop I was able to edit local repositories and then
push them to the origin online on GitHub. After every session of editing the website I would commit all changes made and
did this regularly throughout the development process. At one point I had lost a lot of progress because none of my work
was backed up, after this I made sure to back up all files.

After review from my mentor, my portfolio had a lot of improvements to be made, mostly regarding responsive design and media query,
to fix this problem I started the project from scratch and relied on Bootstrap as well responsive techniques to fix these issues
from the beginning.

<h3>Media<h3>

I used Icons8.com for all icons.
